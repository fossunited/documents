# FOSS United Manifesto

## Promote FOSS

The FOSS United Community will encourage the use and creation of Free
and Open Source Software.

## Build Cool Stuff

FOSS is not just about building utility programs, we intend to encourage
creativity and innovation in the developer community.

## Strive for Excellence

We shall always champion the cause of good FOSS projects, with code that
is readable and well documented and a surrounding community or ecosystem
that is welcoming and helpful.

## Pragmatism Over Purity

We understand that when it comes to getting things done, if it can only
be performed with a proprietary product and there exists no FOSS
alternative that can be used within the given constraints, we will
accept and accommodate the necessary, while continuing to encourage the
move to a FOSS alternative as soon as one becomes viable.

## Respect Individual Freedom and Choice

We understand that people have the freedom to decide what tools suit
best their needs. We will not judge people for the choices they make
for themselves.

## Be Nice and Welcoming

Be nice and welcoming to everyone in the community. Avoid language
that will hurt anyone or make them feel less welcoming.

## Disagree With Respect

We consider it a healthy sign for the community to have multiple
different views and it is perfectly fine when you don't agree with some
of the ideas shared by others. Please disagree with respect.
