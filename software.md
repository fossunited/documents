# FOSS United Community Software Policy
This policy is devised to guide, but not mandate, software choices within the 
FOSS United Community.

- Define what we (the FOSS United Community) wish to do. Ask ourselves 
whether what we wish to do will help in full-fulling the community's goals.
- Define your requirements for the software solution clearly. Clearly 
differentiate between needs and wants. Needs are features that are crucial to 
performing the task at hand and wants are niceties, things we can do without.
- Look for FOSS solutions that are capable of meeting the needs at a level 
that's acceptable to the community. Focus should be on the needs.
- Look at the cost in terms of pricing, effort and time that the community needs 
to spend to be able to use solution and constantly look for ways we can lower 
such barriers and consider supporting the project if that helps.
- When a solution is available in the FOSS ecosystem use it.
- When such a solution is not available in the ecosystem assuming that this is 
the only thing that prevents us from doing something that will benefit the cause 
of FOSS United then look for proprietary solutions.
- Assess the costs of each solution in terms of privacy, freedom, pricing, effort 
and time that the community needs to spend to be able to use software and then 
make a choice as a community.
- All choices needs to be made in a democratic fashion. Enough time and effort 
should be spent to form a collective decision as a community rather than make 
decisions based on the opinions of a few people that happened to be online 
when the issue was being discussed.

Software choices are not meant to be forced onto individual people volunteering 
their time and effort for FOSS United. For example, a graphic designer producing
an visual for the the community would not be expected to examine their choice of 
tools. Most importantly, any output should be available in an open format, usable
by a variety of tools.
